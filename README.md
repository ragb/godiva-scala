# Godiva's Scala Utilities

Godiva-scala is a set of utilities I've created during my scala development work which can be reused between projects.

Most of this code is used in various projects, altough this library itself is not yet est-covered.

This is a work in progress so expect more code and documentation in the future.

### Modules

The project is composed of various modules, pick just the ones you need.

* godiva-core: core classes, dependency of all other modules. Now just contains pagination definitions.
* godiva-slick: Slick Skafolding utilities and pagination support.
* godiva-spray: spray utillities, now just contains pagination directives.
